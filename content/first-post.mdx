When I decided to create my personal portfolio and blog, I wanted it to be more than just a simple website - I wanted it to be a reflection of my skills and interests as a developer.

## Tech Stack Comparison

I evaluated several options before settling on my final tech stack. Here's what the comparison looked like:

| Feature | Next.js | Gatsby | Astro |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Static Generation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Server Components | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Learning Curve | Moderate | Steep | Easy |
| MDX Support | Built-in | Plugin | Built-in |
| Community Size | Large | Large | Growing |

After careful consideration, I chose Next.js for its robust features and excellent developer experience.

## Tech Stack

I built this website using a modern stack that prioritizes performance and developer experience:

- **Next.js**: For its excellent static site generation and dynamic capabilities
- **MDX**: Allowing me to write content in Markdown while embedding React components
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid styling and consistent design
- **TypeScript**: Because type safety is always a good idea!

## Why These Choices?

The combination of Next.js and MDX is particularly powerful for a developer blog. I can write my posts in Markdown (like this one!), but when I need more interactive elements, I can seamlessly embed React components. For example:

```jsx
// A simple example of embedding React components in MDX
import { CodeBlock } from '../components/CodeBlock'

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
  console.log("Hello, Portfolio!");
</CodeBlock>
```

## Learning Points

Building this site taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Content Structure Matters**: Organizing content with MDX requires thoughtful file structure
2. **Performance Optimization**: Static generation with Next.js makes the site blazing fast
3. **Design Systems**: Tailwind CSS helped me maintain consistent styling across components

## What's Next? *(Pun Intended)*

I plan to continue improving this site by:
- Adding more interactive components
- Creating more engaging blog content
- Optimizing for better accessibility

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to enhance and expand this digital space!
