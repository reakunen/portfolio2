summary: "My 2025 Summer Internship Recruitment Cycle"
---

This was probably one of the hardest, most challenging, and annoying recruitment cycles I have ever been through. 
This year was supposed to be my best one, as it is for my Junior year - as
usually during your junior year, you are supposed to get the best internship. 
So lets see how it went? 

I think I applied to over 300+ jobs, all for Software Engineering Intern positions, and I only had 9 actual interviews, and had 2 offers. I was pretty miserable this whole year trying to find a job in this absolutely brutal job market; but now I am actually super happy of the result! I will be working at [SoFi](https://www.sofi.com/) this summer ðŸŽ‰

# Stats 

I leetcoded quite a lot, and I thought it was pretty useful. Here is my leetcode statistics:

# Recruiting Process

## Online Asessments

If I recall, I had various online assessments, a lot were from the summer around June - August, ranging from: Citadel, DRW, Asana, Capital One, TikTok, Blackrock, Blackstone, etc. but I believe these were automatically given. 

The ones that I believe weren't automatically given were: 
- Wells Fargo (Hackerrank) 
- ZocDoc (Codesignal)
- Riot Games (Hackerrank) 
- PNC Bank (Hirevue)
- Pendo (Hackerrank, I did not take) 
- Workday (Hackerrank)
- Pimco (Hackerrank) 
- Uber (Codesignal) 

Overall I'm pretty bad since I wasn't able to get past a lot of the online assessments. Here's a more detailed view of my codesignals:

## Interviews

Here are my interviews this year, in timely order, and the process I went through with each company... I had a pretty rough season indeed, going *2 for 9!*

1. **BAE Systems** --> Hiring Manager Behavioral 1 hr --> Offer
2. **Arista Networks** --> Technical 45 min --> Reject
3. **Watershed** --> Recruiter Screen --> Reject
4. **Gusto** --> OA (Codesignal) --> Phone Screen --> Technical 1 hr --> Reject
5. **CrowdStrike** --> OA (Hackerrank) --> Recruiter Screen --> Technical 1 hr --> Hiring Manager Behavioral 30m --> Reject
6. **AT&T** --> OA (Hackerrank) --> Phone Screen --> Technical 1 hr --> Reject
7. **Cylerian** --> Intro call 30 min --> Ghosted
8. **SoFi** --> OA (Hackerrank) --> Recruiter Screen --> Technical 1hr --> Hiring Manager Behavioral 45 min --> System Design 45 min --> Offer 
9. **Chime**: Recruiter Screen --> Behavioral Hiring Manager 30 min --> Technical 1 hr --> Reject
 
## Referrals

I think it is extremely important to utilize your network and get referrals. I was able to get an interview at BAE Systems because I reached out to another Brian Mai on LinkedIn and got a referral there. I was also able to get a CrowdStrike referral by reaching out to people on LinkedIn too!

So in short, yes referrals do help! 

## Offers 

I stopped recruiting now, though  I occasionally get rejection letters in my inbox. I'm pretty happy with the result of this recruitment season as I was able to land 2 offers: 

1. **BAE Systems**: in Poway, San Diego. I actually had signed this offer, but I reneged it later (I am still currently going through the process for the Top Secret security clearance, but I don't know how that's gonna work since I won't work there...) 

2. **Social Finance Inc (SoFi)**: in San Francisco, Bay Area. I gotten the offer in 4/9, which was pretty late, but I was super happy as I actually do use SoFi myself. I honestly think this was the best result I could have gotten out of all the other companies I interviewed for.
