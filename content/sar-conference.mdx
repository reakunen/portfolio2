I had a great experience at the National Missing and Unidentified Persons Conference, held in Las Vegas this year! This was my first ever time going to a conference, so I didn't know what to expect.

We presented about the project we've been working for (IntelliSAR) or AI For Search and Rescue. We had a lot of interest in people utilizing our platform, as currently, the system for search and rescue operations is entirely paper-based, making it difficult for search and rescue teams to manage and coordinate information effectively.
The IntelliSAR platform helps digitalize information by having all the search and rescue forms and information online (on a website and mobile app). We also integrate machine learning models to help predict where someone will most likely be during a search and rescue mission - that's where the AI part comes in!

As a member of the usability testing team, I helped demonstrate the platform and gathered crucial feedback to understand how search and rescue operations can be improved. This valuable insight will be incorporated into our platform's development. 

Here is the poster we made for the conference!
