This was probably one of the hardest, most challenging, and annoying recruitment cycles I have ever been through. 
This year was supposed to be my best one, as
usually during your junior year, you are supposed to get the best internship. 
So lets see how it went? 

I think I applied to over 300+ jobs, all for Software Engineering Intern positions, and I only had 9 actual interviews, and had 2 offers. I was pretty miserable this whole year trying to find a job in this absolutely brutal job market; but now I am actually super happy of the result! I will be working at [SoFi](https://www.sofi.com/) this summer 🎉

## My Stats 

### Leetcode 
I honestly don't think I leetcoded enough. Overall, I thought it was somewhat useful. Here is my leetcode statistics:

To be honest now that I look at it, I think I should have leetcoded more... that probably would have helped me a lot more on my technicals. I used [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/) to study for my interviews though.

### Resume 

I had a lot of previous internships, I think the I was able to get a lot of callbacks from banks/ fintech because of my past experience
at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 

I also had a lot of high-impact projects such as [maihoney.com](https://www.maihoney.com) and [dormme.app](https://www.dormme.app)

I was also applying to jobs using this [resume](/resume/brian_mai_resume_2026.pdf)
## The Recruiting Process

### Referrals

I think it is extremely important to utilize your network and get referrals. I was able to get an interview at BAE Systems because I reached out to another Brian Mai on LinkedIn and got a referral there. I was also able to get a CrowdStrike referral by reaching out to people on LinkedIn too!

So in short, yes referrals do help! Use LinkedIn and DM/ connect with those recruiters or random people!    

### Online Asessments

If I recall, I had various online assessments, a lot were from the summer around June - August, ranging from: Citadel, DRW, Asana, Capital One, TikTok, Blackrock, Blackstone, etc. but I believe these were automatically given. 

The ones that I believe weren't automatically given were: 
- Wells Fargo (Hackerrank) 
- ZocDoc (Codesignal)
- Riot Games (Hackerrank) 
- PNC Bank (Hirevue)
- Pendo (Hackerrank, I did not take) 
- Workday (Hackerrank)
- Pimco (Hackerrank) 
- Uber (Codesignal) 

Overall I'm pretty bad since I wasn't able to get past a lot of the online assessments. Here's a more detailed view of my codesignals:

### Interviews

Here are my interviews this year, in timely order, and the process I went through with each company... I had a pretty rough season indeed, going *2 for 9!*

2. **Arista Networks** --> Technical 45 min --> Reject ❌
3. **Watershed** --> Recruiter Screen --> Reject ❌

9. **Chime**: Recruiter Screen --> Behavioral Hiring Manager 30 min --> Technical 1 hr --> Reject ❌
 

### Job Offers 

I stopped recruiting now, though  I occasionally get rejection letters in my inbox. I'm pretty happy with the result of this recruitment season as I was able to land 2 offers: 

1. **BAE Systems** 🪖: in Poway, San Diego. I actually had signed this offer, but I reneged it later (I am still currently going through the process for the Top Secret security clearance, but I don't know how that's gonna work since I won't work there...) 

2. **Social Finance Inc (SoFi) 💸**: in San Francisco, Bay Area. I gotten the offer in 4/9, which was pretty late, but I was super happy as I actually do use SoFi myself. I honestly think this was the best result I could have gotten out of all the other companies I interviewed for.
